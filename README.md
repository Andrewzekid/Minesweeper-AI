# Minesweeper AI
This AI was created using Propositional Logic. 
Propositional logic involves combining propositions (e.g: It is raining outside, and It is sunny outside) into more complex representations (It is raining and sunny outside) which allow for inferences to be made.
In the case of minesweeper, given some propositions (e.g: "There are 2 mines in the neighboring squares" and "One mine must be on square X") provided to us by the game, we can deduce useful information (e.g: "Since there are two mines and we know one mine is on square X, the other must be on square Y").

## Demonstration
